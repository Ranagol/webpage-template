 * it activates the UserApiController, and as an argumenet sends the controller a 
 * newly created ApiRequest object. During creation, the ApiRequest object 
 * automatically gets the request data, and this data will be stored in the 
 * ApiRequest object. Which is passed as an argument to the controller.
